TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.1.ZIP 

Provided by Bjorn Sandvik, thematicmapping.org

Use this dataset with care, as several of the borders are disputed.

The original shapefile (world_borders.zip, 3.2 MB) was downloaded from the Mapping Hacks website:

The dataset was derived by Schuyler Erle from public domain sources.
Sean Gilles did some clean up and made some enhancements.
