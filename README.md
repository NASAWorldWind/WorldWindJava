# WorldWind Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava)

3D virtual globe API for desktop Java, developed by NASA. Provides a geographic context with high-resolution terrain, for visualizing geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D. Developers can customize the globe's terrain and imagery. Provides a collection of shapes for displaying and interacting with geographic data and representing a range of geometric objects.

- [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov) has setup instructions, developers guides, API documentation and more
- [WorldWind Forum](https://forum.worldwindcentral.com) provides help from the WorldWind community
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) is used by the NASA WorldWind development team

###### From a Windows Development Environment

- Download and extract the [Latest Release](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/latest)
- Open the Command Prompt
```bash
cd [WorldWind release]
run-demo.bat
```

###### From a Linux or macOS Development Environment

- Download and extract the [Latest Release](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/latest)
- Open the Terminal app
```bash
cd [WorldWind release]
sh run-demo.bash
```

###### Troubleshooting
   
WorldWind requires a modern graphics card with a current driver. Most display problems are caused by out-of-date 
graphics drivers. On Windows, visit your graphics card manufacturer's web site for the latest driver: NVIDIA, ATI or 
Intel. The drivers are typically under a link named Downloads or Support. If you're using a laptop, the latest drivers 
are found at the laptop manufacturer's web site.

## JOGL Native Binaries

JOGL performs runtime extraction of native binaries. Some deployment situations may not allow this because it extracts 
the binaries to the application userâ€™s temp directory. Runtime extraction can be avoided by by modifying WorldWind 
Java's JOGL distribution to load native binaries directly from the library path instead of dynamically using the native 
binary JAR files as follows:
                                                                                                     
1. Extract the GlueGen and JOGL native binary JAR files for the desired platform.
   These JAR files follow the naming pattern gluegen-rt-natives-PLATFORM.jar and jogl-all-natives-PLATFORM.jar
2. Place the extracted native binaries either in the program's working directory or in a location specified as the
   library path. The following JOGL user's guide page outlines supported library path variables:
   https://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/userguide/index.html#traditionallibraryloading
3. Remove the GlueGen and JOGL native binary JAR files from your application's workspace.
   JOGL attempts to use the native binary JAR files before loading from the library path, so these files must not be
   deployed with the application.
4. When running, specify the JVM argument -Djogamp.gluegen.UseTempJarCache=false
