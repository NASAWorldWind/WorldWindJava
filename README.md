[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava)

3D virtual globe API for desktop Java, developed by NASA. Provides a geographic context, complete with terrain, for 
visualizing geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D. World Wind Java provides high-resolution terrain and 
imagery, retrieved from remote servers automatically as needed. Developers can provide custom terrain and imagery. 
Contains a rich set of features for displaying and interacting with geographic data and representing a wide range of 
geometric objects. More information at [NASAWorldWind.github.io](https://nasaworldwind.github.io).
