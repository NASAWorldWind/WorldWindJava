/**
 * TacticalGraphic provides a common interface for displaying a graphic from a symbology set. A graphic can be an icon
 * that is drawn a geographic position, a vector graphic that is positioned using one or more control points, or a line
 * or polygon that is styled according to the symbol set's specification. See the TacticalGraphic <a title="Tactical
 * Graphic Usage Guide" href="https://goworldwind.org/developers-guide/symbology/tactical-graphics/"
 * target="_blank">Usage Guide</a> for instructions on using TacticalGraphic in an application.
 * <p/>
 * See the {@link gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.symbology.Symbology} and {@link gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.symbology.TacticalGraphics}
 * example applications for examples of how to use tactical graphics.
 * <p/>
 * <h1>Construction</h1>
 * <p/>
 * TacticalGraphics are typically created by an instance of {@link TacticalGraphicFactory}. Each graphic within a symbol
 * set is identified by a string identifier. The format of this identifier depends on the symbol set. For example, a
 * MIL-STD-2525 Symbol Identification Code (SIDC) is a string of 15 characters.
 * <p/>
 * You will need to instantiate the appropriate factory for the symbol set that you intend to use.  For example, {@link
 * gov.nasa.worldwind.symbology.milstd2525.MilStd2525GraphicFactory} creates graphics for the MIL-STD-2525 symbology
 * set.
 * <p/>
 * The TacticalGraphic interface provides access to settings common to all tactical graphics. TacticalGraphic extends
 * the {@link Renderable} interface, so you can add a TacticalGraphic directly to a {@link
 * gov.nasa.worldwind.layers.RenderableLayer}. Here's an example of creating a graphic from the MIL-STD-2525 symbol
 * set:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * // Create a graphic factory for MIL-STD-2525
 * TacticalGraphicFactory factory = new MilStd2525GraphicFactory();
 *
 * // Specify the control points for the line
 * List<Position> positions = Arrays.asList(
 *     Position.fromDegrees(34.7327, -117.8347, 0),
 *     Position.fromDegrees(34.7328, -117.7305, 0));
 *
 * // Specify a text modifier
 * AVList modifiers = new AVListImpl();
 * modifiers.setValue(SymbologyConstants.UNIQUE_DESIGNATION, "Alpha");
 *
 * // Create a graphic for a MIL-STD-2525 hostile phase line. The first argument is the symbol identification code
 * // (SIDC) that identifies the type of graphic to create.
 * TacticalGraphic graphic = factory.createGraphic("GHGPGLP----AUSX", positions, modifiers);
 *
 * // Create a renderable layer to display the tactical graphic. This example adds only a single graphic, but many
 * // graphics can be added to a single layer.
 * RenderableLayer graphicLayer = new RenderableLayer();
 * graphicLayer.addRenderable(graphic);
 *
 * // Add the layer to the WorldWindow's model and request that the layer redraw itself. The WorldWindow draws the
 * // graphic on the globe at the specified position. Interactions between the graphic and the cursor are returned in
 * // the WorldWindow's picked object list, and reported to the WorldWindow's select listeners.
 * WorldWindow wwd = ... // A reference to your application's WorldWind instance.
 * wwd.getModel().getLayers().add(graphicLayer);
 * wwd.redraw();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The symbol identifier ({@code GHGPGLP----AUSX}) tells the factory what type of graphic to create,  and how the
 * graphic should be styled. In the example above we added a text modifier of "Alpha" to identify our shape. These
 * parameters can be specified using a parameter list when the TacticalGraphic is created, as shown above. They can also
 * be set after creation using setters in the TacticalGraphic interface.
 * <p/>
 * <h1>Modifiers</h1>
 * <p/>
 * Many graphics support text or graphic modifiers. Each modifier is identified by a String key. The set of possible
 * modifiers is determined by the symbol set. Modifiers can be specified in the parameter list when a graphic is
 * created, or using {@link #setModifier(String, Object) setModifier} after the graphic has been created.
 * <p/>
 * For example, a MIL-STD-2525 General Area graphic can have a text modifier that identifies the area. Here's an example
 * of how to specify the modifier when the graphic is created:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * AVList modifiers = new AVListImpl();
 * modifiers.setValue(SymbologyConstants.UNIQUE_DESIGNATION, "Boston"); // Text that identifies the area enclosed by
 *                                                                      //  the  graphic.
 *
 * List<Position> positions = ...; // List of positions that define the boundary of the area.
 * TacticalGraphic graphic = milstd2525Factory.createGraphic("GHGPGAG----AUSX", positions, modifiers);
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The modifier can also be set (or changed) after the graphic is created:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * // Create the graphic
 * TacticalGraphic graphic = milstd2525Factory.createGraphic("GHGPGAG----AUSX", positions, null);
 * graphic.setModifier(SymbologyConstants.UNIQUE_DESIGNATION, "Boston");
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <h1>Position</h1>
 * <p/>
 * Each tactical graphic is positioned by one or more control points. How many points are required depends on the type
 * of graphic.  A point graphic will only require one point. A more complex shape may require three or four, and a line
 * or area may allow any number.
 * <p/>
 * Here is an example of how to create a point graphic in the MIL-STD-2525 symbol set:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * Position position = Position.fromDegrees(34.9362, -118.2559, 0);
 * TacticalGraphic graphic = milstd2525Factory.createPoint("GFGPAPD----AUSX", position, null);
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * More complicated graphics will require more control points. MIL-STD-2525 defines a template for each type of tactical
 * graphic. Each template identifies how many control points are required for the graphic, and how the points are
 * interpreted. The TacticalGraphic requires a list of Position objects, which identify the control points in the same
 * order as in the specification. For example, in order to create a graphic that requires three control points we need
 * to create a list of positions that specifies the three points in order:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * List<Position> positions = Arrays.asList(
 *     Position.fromDegrees(34.5073, -117.8380, 0), // PT. 1
 *     Position.fromDegrees(34.8686, -117.5088, 0), // PT. 2
 *     Position.fromDegrees(34.4845, -117.8495, 0)); // PT. 3
 *
 * TacticalGraphic graphic = milstd2525Factory.createGraphic("GFGPSLA----AUSX", positions, null);
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <h1>Sub-interfaces of TacticalGraphic</h1>
 * <p/>
 * TacticalGraphic describes any tactical graphic in the most general terms: a list of positions and modifiers. However,
 * this general interface is not convenient for all graphics. For example, when creating a circle graphic it is more
 * convenient to access the radius of the circle directly than to set a modifier that affects the radius. Sub-interfaces
 * of tactical graphic provide more convenient methods for manipulating common types of graphics. Instances of these
 * sub-interfaces can be created directly using a TacticalGraphicFactory. The sub-interfaces are:
 * <p/>
 * <ul> <li>{@link TacticalPoint}- Graphics positioned by a single point.</li> <li>{@link TacticalCircle} - Graphics
 * positioned by a center point and radius.</li> <li>{@link TacticalQuad} - Rectangles with a length and width.</li>
 * <li>{@link TacticalRoute} - A series of point graphics connected by lines and treated as a single graphic.</li>
 * </ul>
