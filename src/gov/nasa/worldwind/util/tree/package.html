<p>A tree control drawn in the WorldWindow. The user can interact with the tree. The basic tree implementation renders
   the tree similar to a file browser tree, but other layouts can be provided.</p>

<p>See {@link gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.util.TreeControl} for an example of using the tree. {@link
   gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.LayerTreeUsage} is an example of using the tree control to display a tree of
   layers.</p>
