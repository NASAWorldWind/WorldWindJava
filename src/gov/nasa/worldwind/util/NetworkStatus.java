/**
 * Provides tracking of per-host network availability. Host computers that fail network requests can be logged to the
 * implementing object's tracking list. When a host has been logged a specified number of times, it is marked as
 * unreachable. Users can query instances of classes implementing this interface to determine whether a host has been
 * marked as unreachable.
 * <p/>
 * Users are expected to invoke the {@link #logUnavailableHost(java.net.URL)} method when an attempt to contact a host
 * fails. Each invocation increments the failure count by one. When the count exceeds the attempt limit, the host is
 * marked as unreachable. When attempts to contact the host <em>are</em> successful, users should invoke {@link
 * #logAvailableHost(java.net.URL)} method to clear its status.
 * <p/>
 * A host may become reachable at a time subsequent to its being logged. To detect this, the implementation marks a host
 * as not unreachable after a specifiable interval of time. If the host is once more logged as unavailable, its entry
 * returns to the unavailable state. This cycle continues indefinitely.
 * <p/>
 * Methods are provided to determine whether the public network can be reached and whether the NASA WorldWind servers
 * cab be reached. The addresses used to detect public network access can be explicitly specified.
