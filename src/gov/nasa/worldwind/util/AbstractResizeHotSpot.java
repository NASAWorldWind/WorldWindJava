/**
 * A HotSpot for resizing a frame or window. This class handles the resize input events, but does does not actually draw
 * the resize controls. The HotSpot is defined by a direction, for example, {@link AVKey#NORTH} indicates that the
 * HotSpot resizes the frame vertically from the north edge (the user clicks the top edge of the frame and drags
 * vertically).
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class should be added to the picked object when the edge or corner of the frame is picked.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must the implement {#getSize}, {#setSize}, {#getScreenPoint}, and {#setScreenPoint} to manipulate the
 * frame that they want to resize.
