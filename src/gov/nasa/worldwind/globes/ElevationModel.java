/**

 * An <code>ElevationModel</code> often approximates elevations at multiple levels of spatial resolution. For any given
 * viewing position, the model determines an appropriate target resolution. That target resolution may not be
 * immediately achievable, however, because the corresponding elevation data might not be locally available and must be
 * retrieved from a remote location. When this is the case, the <code>Elevations</code> object returned for a sector
 * holds the resolution achievable with the data currently available. That resolution may not be the same as the target
 * resolution. The achieved resolution is made available in the interface.
