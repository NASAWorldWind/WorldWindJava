/**
 * A shape that is positioned and oriented independently of its defining geometry. This shape typically represents 3D
 * models imported from COLLADA and other 3D file formats. The model's geometry is defined in its own coordinate system;
 * properties of this shape place and orient the model geographically. Specific model types subclass this class to
 * provide their implementation and any additional properties.
 * <p>
 * This class also accepts a resource map to independently link resources named in the model definition (the defining
 * model file) to actual resources. Each map entry's key is a resource name as expressed in the model definition. Each
 * map entry's value is the reference to the actual resource. The reference is interpreted by rules specific to the
 * model format, but typically may be a relative or absolute file reference or a URL to a local or remote resource. If
 * the map or an entry referred to by the model definition is not defined, resource references are typically considered
 * relative to the location of the model definition's location.
 * <p>
 * In the case of a COLLADA file referenced from a KML file, relative references are considered relative to the location
 * of the KML file. If the file is KMZ, relative references are considered references to resources within the KMZ
 * archive.
 * <p>
 * This class applies {@link ShapeAttributes} to the shape, but the effect of some of those attributes, such as {@link
 * ShapeAttributes#isDrawOutline()} is dependent on the specific implementation of this <code>AbstractGeneralShape</code>. See
 * the class description of those shapes to determine how shape attributes are applied.
