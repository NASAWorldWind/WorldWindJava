/**
 * Restorable is an interface for describing the current state of an object, and restoring an object's
 * state. Object state descriptions will be formatted as an XML document string. This allows the state description
 * to be located in a file, reside in a database, or be passed over a network.
 * <p>
 * The exact structure of the XML document is the responsibility of the implementation. However, to encourage data
 * sharing between similar implementations, each implementation of Restorable should design
 * <code>restoreState</code> to accept and ignore unknown structures in state documents. Otherwise, implementations
 * should clearly document how they will behave when encountering an unknown structure.
 * <p>
 * See the WorldWideWeb Consortium's (W3C) documentation on
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/">Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 </a> for information on XML.
