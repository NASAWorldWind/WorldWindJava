/**
 * This class signals that an object or terrain is under the cursor and identifies that object and the operation that
 * caused the signal. See the <em>Field Summary</em> for a description of the possible operations. When a SelectEvent
 * occurs, all select event listeners registered with the associated {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.WorldWindow} are called.
 * Select event listeners are registered by calling {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.WorldWindow#addSelectListener(SelectListener)}.
 * <p/>
 * A <code>ROLLOVER</code> SelectEvent is generated every frame when the cursor is over a visible object either because
 * the user moved it there or because the WorldWindow was repainted and a visible object was found to be under the
 * cursor. A <code>ROLLOVER</code> SelectEvent is also generated when there are no longer any objects under the cursor.
 * Select events generated for objects under the cursor have a non-null pickPoint, and contain the top-most visible
 * object of all objects at the cursor position.
 * <p/>
 * A <code>BOX_ROLLOVER</code> SelectEvent is generated every frame when the selection box intersects a visible object
 * either because the user moved or expanded it or because the WorldWindow was repainted and a visible object was found
 * to intersect the box. A <code>BOX_ROLLOVER</code> SelectEvent is also generated when there are no longer any objects
 * intersecting the selection box. Select events generated for objects intersecting the selection box have a non-null
 * pickRectangle, and contain all top-most visible objects of all objects intersecting the selection box.
 * <p/>
 * If a select listener performs some action in response to a select event, it should call the event's {@link
 * #consume()} method in order to indicate to subsequently called listeners that the event has been responded to and no
 * further action should be taken. Left press select events should not be consumed unless it is necessary to do so.
 * Consuming left press events prevents the WorldWindow from gaining focus, thereby preventing it from receiving key
 * events.
 * <p/>
 * If no object is under the cursor but the cursor is over terrain, the select event will identify the terrain as the
 * picked object and will include the corresponding geographic position. See {@link
 * gov.nasa.worldwind.pick.PickedObject#isTerrain()}.
