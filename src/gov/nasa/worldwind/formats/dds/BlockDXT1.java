/**
 * <code>BlockDXT1</code> is a data structure representing the compressed color values in a single 64 bit DXT1 block.
 * The DXT1 block contains two explicit 16 bit colors (quantized as RGB 565), which define one or two additional
 * implicit colors. If the first color is greater than the second, then two additional colors are defined for a total
 * of four. The two colors are defined as color2=(2*color0 + 1*color1)/3, and color3=(1*color0 + 2*color1)/3. If the
 * first color is less than the second color, then one additional color is defined for a total of three colors, and the
 * fourth color is interpreted as transparent black. Finally, the block contains 4x4 2 bit indices into the array of
 * four colors (one of which may be transparent black).
 * <p>
 * From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb204843(VS.85).aspx:
 * If 64-bit blocks - that is, format DXT1 - are used for the texture, it is possible to mix the opaque and 1-bit alpha
 * formats on a per-block basis within the same texture. In other words, the comparison of the unsigned integer
 * magnitude of color_0 and color_1 is performed uniquely for each block of 16 texels.
