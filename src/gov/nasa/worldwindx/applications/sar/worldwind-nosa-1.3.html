    class="style2">
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Contributor, with respect to its own contribution to the Subject
Software, hereby grants to each Recipient a non-exclusive, world-wide,
royalty-free license to engage in the following activities pertaining
to the Subject Software:</span></p>

<p><span class="style9">B. </span><span class="style12">Under Patent Rights</span><span class="style9">:</span><span
    class="style2">
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Contributor, with respect to its own contribution to the Subject
Software, hereby grants to each Recipient under Covered Patents a
non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to engage in the
following activities pertaining to the Subject Software:</span></p>

<p class="style2"><strong>1.</strong> Use<br> <strong>2.</strong> Distribution<br> <strong>3.</strong> Reproduction<br>
    <strong>4.</strong> Sale<br> <strong>5.</strong> Offer for Sale</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>C.</strong> The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination of a
    Contributor&#8217;s Modification and the Subject Software if, at the time the Modification is added by the
    Contributor, the addition of such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the Covered Patents. It does
    not apply to any other combinations that include a Modification.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>D.</strong> The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to sublicense those
    same rights. Such sublicense must be under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style4">3. OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENT</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>A.</strong> Distribution or Redistribution of the Subject Software must be made under this
    Agreement except for additions covered under paragraph 3H.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>1.</strong> Whenever a Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software, a copy of
    this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Subject Software; and<br> <strong>2.</strong> If Recipient
    distributes or redistributes the Subject Software in any form other than source code, Recipient must also make the
    source code freely available, and must provide with each copy of the Subject Software information on how to obtain
    the source code in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>B.</strong> Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice appears prominently
    in the Subject Software:<br> Copyright (C) 2001 United States Government<br> as represented by the Administrator of
    the <br> National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<br> All Rights Reserved.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>C.</strong> Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a
    Modification and must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
    subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these requirements,
    Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the date of the
    alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and consents to characterization of the
    alterations as a Modification, for example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
    indirectly, from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be
    revoked.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>D.</strong> A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a
    copyright notice has been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express
    permission of the Contributor who added the notice.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>E.</strong> A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any
    promotional, advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any
    prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial advantage by
    the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient&#8217;s participation in this Agreement. </p>

<p class="style2"><strong>F.</strong> In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software,
    each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting
    the following website: <a href="http://opensource.arc.nasa.gov/">http://opensource.arc.nasa.gov</a>. Recipient&#8217;s
    name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification
    available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided above how to access
    the Modification.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>G.</strong> Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be
    Contributor&#8217;s original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or rules,
    and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>H.</strong> A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do
    so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a Recipient
    must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by
    that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for
    any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such
    Recipient.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>I.</strong> A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate
    software not governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
    case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is subject to
    this Agreement.</p>

<p class="style2"><strong>J.</strong> Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice
    that export of any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license from the
    U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.
    Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor that, if required, it shall be issued.
    Nothing granted herein provides any such export license. </p>
