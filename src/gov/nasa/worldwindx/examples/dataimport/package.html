<!--<h1>Importing Imagery and Elevations</h1>-->

<p>
    This package contains examples that show how to import imagery and elevation data and how to use it to create
    layers, renderables and elevation models. Since this type of data is typically in the form of a raster, WorldWind
    calls it <em>raster data</em>. WorldWind can import many formats of raster data, including but not limited to JPEG,
    JPEG-2000, PNG, and DTED, and GeoTIFF for both imagery and elevations. Data can be imported from a local or network
    disk, or in many cases directly from a network URL. This overview describes the import process and identifies
    example programs showing exactly how import is done.</p>

<p>
    Note that WorldWind can also draw data incrementally from web services such as WMS and WFS, but this overview
    covers only importing bulk data from files or streams.</p>

<p>
    When importing data, WorldWind reprojects it to the WGS-84 datum and latitude, longitude coordinates, which is
    WorldWind's internal coordinate reference system (also known as EPSG:4326).</p>

<p>
    In addition to some internal importer classes, WorldWind uses {@link javax.imageio.ImageIO} and the open-source
    GDAL library to read and potentially reproject data on import. This enables WorldWind to import a very wide range
    of image formats and projection types. It also makes it possible to import very large data sets composed of many
    files.</p>

<p>
    Here is a list of the most commonly used formats supported, see {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.data} for the full
    list:</p>
<ul>
    <li>GeoTIFF (for both imagery and elevations)</li>
    <li>PNG</li>
    <li>JPEG</li>
    <li>JPEG-2000</li>
    <li>GIF</li>
    <li>DTED</li>
    <li>RPF</li>
    <li>NITF</li>
    <li>MrSID</li>
    <li>BIL</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importing vs. Installing</h2>

<p>
    Raster data can be <em>imported</em> for just the current session or <em>installed</em> for permanent availability.
</p>

<h3>Installing Imagery and Elevation Data</h3>

<p>
    Installing data adds it to a permanent location on the local computer. It's installed in a way that facilitates
    rapid access by WorldWind. Unlike the WorldWind cache, installed data is never automatically deleted. Applications
    may specify the installation location, but by default the location is:
<ul>
    <li>Mac OS X: <em>/Library/Caches/WorldWindInstalled</em></li>
    <li>Windows: <em>/Users/All Users/Application Data/WorldWindInstalled or /Program Data/WorldWindInstalled</em></li>
    <li>Linux, Solaris: <em>/var/cache/WorldWindInstalled</em></li>
</ul>

<p>These locations are peers to the WorldWind cache directory.</p>

<p>
    Installed imagery is typically displayed as a {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.layers.TiledImageLayer}. Elevation data is
    typically used to create an {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.globes.ElevationModel}. As these classes run, they
    automatically create sub-regions and reduced resolution versions of the data in order to optimize performance. This
    information is saved permanently in the installed-data location. Depending on the size and complexity of the data,
    WorldWind may also create one or two levels of reduced resolution data during installation.</p>

<p>
    When installing data, the source data can be copied to the installed-data directory or left in its original
    location. If the data is not copied, it's of course necessary that it be available and accessible in the original
    location when subsequently needed. The data location is captured in a configuration file stored in the
    installed-data directory for the particular data set. The examples {@link
    gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.dataimport.InstallImagery} and {@link
    gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.dataimport.InstallElevations} shows how to use this file to create a layer and an
    elevation model, respectively.</p>

<h3>Data Installation Examples</h3>

<p>
    The example {@link gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.dataimport.InstallImagery} shows how to install imagery and use it to
    create a {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.layers.TiledImageLayer}. The example {@link
    gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.dataimport.InstallElevations} shows how to install elevations and use them to create an
    elevation model. Both classes are heavily commented to describe their operation.</p>

<h3>Importing Imagery and Elevation Data for One-time Use</h3>

<p>
    It's often the case that data is needed only during a current session. In this case the data should be imported but
    not installed. The {@link gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.dataimport.ImportImagery} and {@link
    gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.dataimport.ImportElevations} examples show how to import data and use it to create a
    {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.render.SurfaceImage} for imagery and an {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.globes.ElevationModel}
    for elevations.</p>

<h2>Deploying Data Import Capability</h2>

<p>
    See the package description of {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.data} for data import deployment instructions, including
    deployment with Java Web Start.</p>
