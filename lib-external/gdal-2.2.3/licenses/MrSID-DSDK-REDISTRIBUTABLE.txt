The following information is provided to aid you in understanding what your
rights and responsibilities are, under the terms of the license, when using
and distributing the MrSID Decode SDK for Raster.  These comments are NOT to be
considered legally binding.  Please contact LizardTech or your own legal
counsel for specific interpretation and guidance.

  * If you are shipping an application or similar package in binary
    (executable) form, your application may link either statically or
    dynamically to our SDK libraries.  You may ship our DLLs and SOs alongside
    your application.
    [section 1.3]

  * If you are providing an application or similar package in source form,
    e.g. for a "build-kit" style distribution, you may include in your
    distribution any of the files in the Decode SDK.  (This is intended to
    specifically allow your customers to "build" your MrSID-enabled package
    without requiring them to download anything from our website.)
    [section 1.3]
    
  * Your application must include the statement of ownership / copyright
    notice given in section 2.2.  Depending on the nature of your
    application, this notice can be given in an "About Box", in a "CREDITS"
    or "COPYRIGHTS" file, or other similar means.
